# Zillow Imitation Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Zillow Imitation Project. This repository houses a Spring Cloud-based house rental application that closely imitates the functionalities and design of Zillow. This project serves as a practical exploration of microservices architecture using modern technologies like MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and RabbitMQ.

## Features
- Property Listings: Users can view a variety of rental properties, each detailed with photos, prices, and descriptions.
- Search Functionality: Robust search capabilities powered by Elasticsearch, allowing filters for location, price range, number of bedrooms, and more.
- User Accounts: Users can create accounts to save favorite listings and contact property managers directly.
- Admin Panel: A Vue.js and Vuetify-based dashboard for administrators to manage property listings.

## Technologies Used
- `Spring Boot`: Simplifies the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications.
- `Spring Cloud`: Facilitates building robust microservices using patterns like service discovery, configuration management, and routing.
- `MongoDB`: NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- `Redis`: In-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- `Elasticsearch`: Search engine based on the Lucene library, perfect for powerful search functionalities.
- `RabbitMQ`: Advanced message queuing protocol used for handling service-to-service communication.
- `Vue.js` and `Vuetify`: Progressive JavaScript framework and material design component framework used for building the admin panel.
